## Project 2 - Would You Rather app

An app that allows you to play the "Would You Rather?" game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: "Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?". Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

Technologies: The projects demonstrates the understanding of React, Redux, props, states, Components, JSX, AJAX, and JavaScript(ECMAScript) 6.

## Project 3 - UdaciCards - A Mobile Flashcard App

A mobile application (Android and iOS) that allows you to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow you to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

Technologies: The project encompasses the fundamental aspects of building a native application including handling infinite lists, routing, and user input.
